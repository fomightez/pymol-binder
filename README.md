# pymol-binder
PyMol able to be run via MyBinder.org.

Click `launch binder` to begin.

This repo is meant to allow running PyMol without the typical graphical user interface (GUI), instead running headless using the command line/scripting, in order to extract details from stucture files or to render single static images or frames to compose into a movie.

Technical note
--------------

The necessary packages to may PyMol useable via the MyBinder.org system was worked out by [Dominique Sydow](https://github.com/dominiquesydow) [here](https://github.com/dominiquesydow/pymolmeetsbinder).
