    "We'll get a structure file using a bash shell command (unix command) this time and then iterate on a chain in that structure. We'll use this instead of PyMOL's `fetch` command because **the intended use case for this approach is when the structure is not yet published**. For example, imagine you've had [I-TASSER](https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) make you a model of your protein chain of interest. **For published structures, you are much better off using PDBsum's 'protein' tab for the chain of interest.** For example, this is [the protein tab page for chain A of 1d66](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/pdbsum/GetPage.pl?pdbcode=1d66&template=protein.html&r=wiring&l=1&chain=A). The reason it is better to use PDBsum's report is because this has done an official analysis of the secondary structure and even reported a topology wiring diagram, provided on the right side of the page, that makes it easy to be sure the residues that compose a helix or strand of a beta sheet. Therefore, you have an independent call for the secondary structure that you can reference.\n",
